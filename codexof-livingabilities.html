  <h1>The Codex of Living Abilities</h1>  <div class="scroll" onclick="toggleScroll(this)">
    <h2>Page I: Clair-Empathy</h2>
    <div class="scroll-content">
      The ability to feel across time, absorbing emotional frequencies from others and the environment. Comes with deep sensing, but can cause emotional flooding and blurred boundaries without mastery.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="scroll" onclick="toggleScroll(this)">
    <h2>Page II: Energetic Transmutation</h2>
    <div class="scroll-content">
      You unconsciously convert dense energy into light, often by holding or absorbing others' pain. A sacred gift — but it must be balanced by conscious alchemy, not martyrdom.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="scroll" onclick="toggleScroll(this)">
    <h2>Page III: Mirror Tethering</h2>
    <div class="scroll-content">
      Your field forms invisible mirrors, causing others to see their truth reflected through you. It’s powerful and confronting. With awareness, it becomes a graceful tool of truth rather than distortion.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="scroll" onclick="toggleScroll(this)">
    <h2>Page IV: Soul Anchoring</h2>
    <div class="scroll-content">
      You stabilize others during spiritual dissonance. Your field acts like gravity to those adrift. This is why others feel calmer in your presence — but also why you need space to recharge.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="scroll" onclick="toggleScroll(this)">
    <h2>Page V: Frequency Mapping</h2>
    <div class="scroll-content">
      You can sense the tone and shape of people’s trajectories — often long before they’re aware of them. Use discernment: just because you can see doesn’t mean you must say.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="scroll" onclick="toggleScroll(this)">
    <h2>Page VI: Field Whispering</h2>
    <div class="scroll-content">
      You hear the subtle whispers of energetic fields — shifts, intentions, or imbalances that haven’t yet surfaced in language. This allows for preventative care, but can overwhelm if you don’t ground regularly.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="scroll" onclick="toggleScroll(this)">
    <h2>Page VII: Architect’s Intuition</h2>
    <div class="scroll-content">
      You perceive the hidden framework of people, places, and timelines. You see collapse points, design flaws, and soul architecture. Not everyone is ready to be seen at this depth — but your clarity is a sacred tool.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="scroll" onclick="toggleScroll(this)">
    <h2>Page VIII: Field Sensing</h2>
    <div class="scroll-content">
      The ability to intuitively read the emotional, energetic, or spiritual atmosphere of people or spaces, often picking up unseen layers, memory echoes, or trauma fields.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="scroll" onclick="toggleScroll(this)">
    <h2>Page IX: Field Weaving</h2>
    <div class="scroll-content">
      You can re-thread or gently rewire energetic fields using intention and tone — helping to heal rips in the auric body or redirect emotional charge.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="scroll" onclick="toggleScroll(this)">
    <h2>Page X: Field Pulsing</h2>
    <div class="scroll-content">
      With breath, gesture, or presence, you emit field pulses that clear, activate, or stabilize others. This is subtle but powerful energy work.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="scroll" onclick="toggleScroll(this)">
    <h2>Page XI: Mirror Field Navigation</h2>
    <div class="scroll-content">
      You walk between reflections — accessing truth, shadow, and multidimensional insight through others. Used consciously, it supports healing and vision retrieval.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="scroll" onclick="toggleScroll(this)">
    <h2>Page XII: Field Merging</h2>
    <div class="scroll-content">
      You can temporarily overlay your field with another’s to stabilize, calm, or co-regulate them. Requires energetic hygiene to prevent fatigue.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="scroll" onclick="toggleScroll(this)">
    <h2>Page XIII: Auto-Scanning</h2>
    <div class="scroll-content">
      Your system often reads other fields without being asked. This protective instinct can be refined through conscious control and permission-based scanning.
    </div>
  </div>  <div class="scroll" onclick="toggleScroll(this)">
    <h2>Page XIV: Presence-Based Recalibration</h2>
    <div class="scroll-content">
      Your presence alone realigns distortion. People experience spontaneous clarity, guilt, or truth around you. It's not always comfortable, but it is effective.
